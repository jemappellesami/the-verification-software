# Verification Software UI

This project is a Vite + React (TypeScript) front-end for the verification dashboard.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+ (or 20+ recommended)
- npm (comes with Node)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. From the project root, go into the app directory:

```bash
cd verification-software
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Run locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open the URL shown in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

## Build for production (optional)

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Notes

- The UI is static and does not connect to a backend yet.
- Main UI code lives in `src/App.tsx` and `src/components/`.
